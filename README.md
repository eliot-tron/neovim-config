# neovim-config
As you can see, it is my neovim configuration. I use it mainly to type in LaTeX and to code in python (and maybe more languages in the future). It is not meant to be usable by other users as it is (I mean you can but it is mostly personnal and sometimes counter intuitive choices). For instance, regarding the LaTeX snippets, I made/tweaked them to use them with my LaTeX packages that you can find [here](https://github.com/eliot-tron/packatron).

# Inspirations
For the latex part, I was strongly inspired by [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/) (I use most of his snippets).
